# American_Airlines_Hackathon
Mini-Hackathon hosted by Aggie Data Science Club and American Airlines

We were provided with the original business data of flight logs over 3 years. Our problem statement was to predict if a passenger is traveling for a business trip or a Leisure trip.

Note: As per the NDA signed with American Airlines and Aggie Data Science Club participants are not allowed to share the data.
